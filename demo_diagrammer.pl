/** <module> Demo of scalable websocket based diagrammer server in SWI-Prolog

Logic languages have a natural affinity to problems best expressed
by 'ball and circle' graphs or 'arrows between boxes' diagrams.

This is a small shared diagrammer application for collaboratively
drawing digraph diagrams. It's based on Jan Wielemaker's =|chatroom.pl|=
demo available at https://github.com/JanWielemaker/swi-chat  .

 @tbd  Write this up after you know where the API is going

  - Create a diagrammerroom using chatroom_create/3 and a thread that
    listens to diagrammer events and broadcasts the changes.

  - Serve a web page that provides the diagrammer frontend.  The frontend
    contains JavaScript that establishes a websocket on /chat.  If
    a websocket is obtained, hand it to to the room using
    chatroom_add/2
